## 4.0

### 🔥🔥🔥 4.0 official version released 🔥🔥🔥

### Design specification adjustment

- Basic rounded corner adjustment, changed from unified `2px` to four-level rounded corners, which are `2px` `4px` `6px` `8px` respectively, which are applied to different scenarios, for example, the rounded corners of the default size Button are adjusted to `6px`.
- Main color adjustment, changed from `#1890ff` to `#1677ff`.
- Overall shadow adjustment, from the original three-level shadow adjustment to two levels, which are used for resident page components (such as Card) and interactive feedback (such as Dropdown).
- Adjust the internal spacing of some components.
- Overall de-wireframing.

### Add 5 new components

- Segmented segment controller
- WaterMark watermark
- QrCode QR code
- FloatButton floating button
- Tour roaming guide

### Technical adjustments

- Deprecated less and adopted CSS-in-JS to better support dynamic themes.
  - All less files are removed, and less variables no longer support leaking.
  - css files are no longer included in the product. Since CSS-in-JS supports importing on demand, the original `ant-design-vue/dist/antd.css` has also been removed. If you need to reset some basic styles, please import `ant-design-vue/dist/reset .css`.
  - If you need to reset the style of the component and don't want to introduce `ant-design-vue/dist/reset.css` to pollute the global style, you can try to use [App component](/components/app), to solve the problem that native elements do not have ant-design-vue specification style.
- Removed css variables and dynamic theme schemes built on top of it.
- LocaleProvider has been deprecated in 3.x (use `<ConfigProvider locale />` instead), we have completely removed the related directories `ant-design-vue/es/locale-provider`, `ant- design-vue/lib/locale-provider`.
- `babel-plugin-import` is no longer supported, CSS-in-JS itself has the ability to load on demand, no longer need plug-in support.

#### Component API adjustments

- The classname API of the component popup is unified to `popupClassName`, and similar APIs such as `dropdownClassName` will be replaced.

  - AutoComplete component
  - Cascader component
  - Select component
  - TreeSelect component
  - TimePicker component
  - DatePicker component
  - Mentions component

- The controlled visibility API of the component popup is unified as `open`, and `visible` and other similar APIs will be replaced.
  - Drawer component `visible` becomes `open`.
  - Modal component `visible` becomes `open`.
  - Dropdown component `visible` becomes `open`.
  - Tooltip component `visible` becomes `open`.
  - Tag component `visible` has been removed.
  - Slider component `tooltip` related API converges to `tooltip` property.
  - Table component `filterDropdownVisible` changed to `filterDropdownOpen`.
- `getPopupContainer`: All `getPopupContainer` needs to ensure that the returned div is unique.
- Drawer `style` and `class` are migrated to the Drawer popup area, and the original attributes are replaced by `rootClassName` and `rootStyle`.

#### Component refactoring and removal

- Remove the `locale-provider` directory. `LocaleProvider` has been removed in v4, please use `ConfigProvider` instead.

- Remove `xxxl` breakpoint attribute in grid layout. `xxxl` attribute has been removed in v4, you can use [theme customization](/docs/vue/customize-theme) to modify `screen[XS|SM|MD|LG|XL|XXL]` to modify the break Point value achieved.

- The BackTop component was deprecated in `4.0.0` and moved to the FloatButton floating button. If needed, it can be imported from FloatButton.
